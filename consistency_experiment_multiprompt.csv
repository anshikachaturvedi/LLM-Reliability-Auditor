Instructional,Explain how to tie a shoelace in three simple steps.,0.1,1,"Here's a simple 3-step guide to tying a shoelace:

**Step 1: Create the Bunny Ears**
Begin by holding your shoelaces together and folding one lace in half to create a ""bunny ear."" Hold the folded lace between your thumb and index finger. Repeat the same step with the other lace, creating another bunny ear.

**Step 2: Cross the Bunny Ears**
Cross the two bunny ears over each other, with the folded ends facing away from you. The lace that was on top should now be on the bottom, and vice versa.

**Step 3: Pull Through and Tighten**
Take the lace that is now on top and pass it through the loop of the other bunny ear. Pull the lace tight to secure the knot. You should now have a secure bow. Adjust the bow as needed to make sure it's comfortable and even."
